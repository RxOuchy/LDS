Things I need to update.

- Get Table Info from the settings XML

- Rework the DB Initialization
    a. First I need to determine if the XML File Exists.
        - If the file does not exists we need to create it and display the Home Screen with DB Init fields (SERVER, USER, PASS, DB) textboxes
        - If the file exists, we need to check to see if the database element exists.
    b. If the database element exists I want to objectify the reading of the xml file, then return the login information and then call the DB connection.
        - Right now this is all done at once and will cause issues if no file exists.

- Write settings to XML

- Determine the AJAX logic to move between pages without reload.

- Fix styles
